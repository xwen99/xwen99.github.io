## Projects

* ECCV 2020 Workshop VIPriors Image Classification Challenge (June 2020 – July 2020)
  * We present a novel two-phase pipeline that leverages self-supervised learning and knowledge distillation to improve the generalization ability of CNN models for image classification under the data-deficient setting.
  * Together with other tricks, we won 2nd place in the VIPriors image classification challenge with only two ensembled models. Our co-authored paper *Distilling Visual Priors from Self-Supervised Learning* has been accepted by ECCV 2020 Workshop VIPriors. \[[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00261)\]

* Video Copy Detection Track of 2019 CCF Big Data & Computing Intelligence Contest (Oct. 2019 – Nov. 2019)
  * Propose chamfer similarity for NDVR and perform frame-level video matching with maximum flow algorithm.
  * Implement all the code from scratch by myself, won 8th out of 705 teams. \[[Code](https://github.com/xwen99/CCF-BDCI-VideoCopyDetection)\]

* Chinese Chess Engine Construction
  * Developed a Chinese Chess Engine featured by its high-efficiency adversarial search algorithm \[[Code](https://github.com/xwen99/starfish)\]
  *	Served as teaching assistant, helped build the Chinese Chess AI competition platform
  * Served as team leader, won the 1st place in the final Chinese Chess AI contest in the course

* FPGA-Based Smart Car (Dec. 2018 - Jan. 2019)
  * Designed structural components with AutoCAD; Designed relevant controlling and planning algorithms; Programmed for related modules such as infrared sensor, ultrasonic sensor, drive motor, Bluetooth with Verilog HDL; Developed relevant controlling Android application
  * Assembled and developed a smart car that support automatic tracking and obstacle avoidance independently
