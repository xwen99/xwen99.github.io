## Projects

* ECCV 2020 Workshop VIPriors Image Classification Challenge
  * We present a novel two-phase pipeline that leverages self-supervised learning and knowledge distillation to improve the generalization ability of CNN models for image classification under the data-deficient setting.
  * Together with other tricks, we won 2nd place in the VIPriors image classification challenge. Our co-authored paper Distilling Visual Priors from Self-Supervised Learning has been accepted by ECCV 2020 Workshop VIPriors. \[[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00261)\]

* Video Copy Detection Track of 2019 CCF Big Data & Computing Intelligence Contest
  * Propose chamfer similarity for NDVR and perform frame-level video matching with maximum flow algorithm.
  * Implement all the code from scratch by myself, won 8th out of 705 teams. \[[Code](https://github.com/xwen99/CCF-BDCI-VideoCopyDetection)\]
